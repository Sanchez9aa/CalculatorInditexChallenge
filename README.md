<h1>Calculator Inditex Challenge</h1>

A calculator project where you can do the most basic operations, plus, there is a special functionality that allows you to work primitively with arrays.

By clicking on the arrow next to the 9, we enter the array mode, resetting everything we had before.

When we are in array mode we can add numbers to our array. When we have at least 2 elements in our array by clicking the arrow again, we will set the first element of our array as the last element.

To return to normal calculator mode click RESET.

There are 3 different themes inside our calculator, you can change them by clicking on the small circular button to the right of the word "THEMES".

This project has been made with React with redux for the operations and themes as well as jest for testing.
